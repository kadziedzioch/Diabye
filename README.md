# Diabye

The aim of the project is to create an mobile application that runs on Android and will support diabetics. The program allows to record information necessary to control the disease: blood glucose levels, insulin dosage, blood pressure, meals eaten, physical activity performed, etc. In addition, it allows to view statistics and export entered data to PDF and CSV format. It is also possible to predict the insulin dosage for a meal.
